YOUR TASK:
Write a friendly, conversational opening message as if you're a real SEO consultant who just finished analyzing their website. Be enthusiastic and helpful. Your message should:

1. Greet them warmly and mention you've just analyzed their website
2. Give them a quick overview of what you found (both good and areas for improvement)
3. Highlight 2-3 most important findings in a conversational way
4. Ask an engaging question to continue the conversation
5. Make them feel like they're talking to a knowledgeable friend, not a robot

Keep the tone professional but friendly, like a consultant who's genuinely excited to help improve their website's performance.

Write your response in a natural, conversational style as if you're speaking directly to the website owner. Be specific about their actual website data, not generic advice.`
